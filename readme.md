# Git & GitHub Practice
My goal for this small group project is to make it possible for us to practice using Git and GitHub. 

This will be very useful exercise for us not only for the Pursuit Program, Capstone Project, but also for our future careers as well.

There will be a small amount of participants to keep this exercise manageable.

Participants: ( A to Z )

- Harold Fachin
- Vandhana Mohan

This repo will contain one text file. With 10 questions. Each member will tackle a questions while keeping communications open on slack to see which participant tackles what questions. This I think will mimic how the workflow for building an app will go. 

The steps I believe we must follow is almost the same as we have been doing. Forking, cloning, making changes, committing, pushing, and creating a pull request.

There is one step missing in the workflow presented above. We have not learned how to create branches and work on them. I think this is a good opportunity to learn how to do that.

## Resources for Git and GitHub
[Getting Started with Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvvvdearAPE&list=PLy4OcwImJzBKzWWb9K_WB3QzaxoiGmxyo)

The link above is a small playlist that I watched to try to understand how git and Github work together. There are some things in those videos that I will be applying to this exercise: one of them being when creating a pull request, my repo on its own will give you a template of what to write in said pull request. 

If you just want to see the video that I'm talking about then just click on this link: [How to Create a Pull Request on Github](https://youtu.be/MjsS4ujX3nU)

The first time I learned about git and Github was with this video. The dude in the video helped me learn so much back in the day. Unfortunately, he no longer owns that YouTube Channel. [Github for Noobs](https://youtu.be/1h9_cB9mPT8)

Another great source to learn about git and git commands is this website: [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

Plus the official git handbook: [Git Handbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Instructions for this exercise
1. Reply to the email that I sent out with the question you will be answering in the text file
2. Fork this repo
3. Create a branch with your name or initials
4. Add your name to the list of participants with a bullet point.
5. Answer the questions in the text file
6. Commit your changes to your branch.
7. Make sure you pull the latest changes from the master branch before you push your changes. [Fetch and Push from origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6rYglziOjM) This video goes into further detail on how to do this.
8. Push the changes from your local machine to your forked repo.
9. Finally in GitHub create a pull request from your newly created branch to the original repo and fill out the template for that pull request. 

So far this is as far as I want to take this exercise. To see how well we can work together as a small team. 

Just as a reminder if you run into any problems please feel free to ask the team on slack or email. I do not claim to be an expert on this subject hence me trying to simulate a real world scenario. If you have any suggestions on how to improve this exercise please let me know. If you run into a problem which none of us can help. Please screenshot the error and do some research. Also, if you find a resources that you think will be helpful to the team please share it with us.

Thank you for participating in this small exercise. 

p.s. I'm not very good at typing so 20% of this was suggested by [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot). Ya'll better get on it, it's free for the first 60 days.
